This macro is for the first world. If the game crashes, it will attempt to connect to the first saved network and rejoins the first act. 
It does not handle scenarios such as long loading and occupied teleport yet.
Only places the unit in the second slot and upgrades it at intervals.
Adding support for other units soon
